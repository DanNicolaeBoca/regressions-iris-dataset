## What is this about?
- A basic example of linear regression using the [iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) availabe in the Python programming language throgh the *scikit-learn* library.
- I made this for my homework during my MSc to  get familiar with the basics of Machine Learning.
